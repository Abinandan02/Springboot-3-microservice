Architecture for a simple employee and department micro service connecting to service-registry, config-server, api-gateway and zipkin tracing.

Currently organization service is not created.

Since each service is created as repo itself to leverage adding on new microservices as and when required.
Below are the current repos involved.
This repository is to give a full picture of the architecture and design.
